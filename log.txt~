Log for the checkers games. This will be updated whenever I push to git

November 14, 3PM
- Program can now correctly generate an array of opening moves

November 13, 10AM
- Board object can now generate possible moves, however it generates 5 too many on the first move.
- Pushing to git so that I can get this done at work after I get my homework done.
